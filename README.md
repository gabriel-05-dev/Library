This is a library project i have built using Javascript.
- It aims to make book-management for a user easy.

How it works :

This library projects stores user's books that they input through a form into an object.
The object is then stored into an array, and the array containing the objects is iterated on displaying the users books.
Each book has a unique identifier (id) which has been implemented for future consideration, for example a search feature, or a sort feature.

-- Some features of this library.

Each book  has a unique read-status which the user can toggle.
All books can be individually removed from the array, or they can be cleared using the "clear" button on the left hand side of the screen.
The user has the options to display/hide their library.
The library is responsive based on screensize.
The form checks to ensure that the criteria has been met, for example pages must be a number.
